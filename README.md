# Basket Project

## Description
This PHP application implements a basket system with the following features:
- Product catalog management.
- Delivery charge rules based on the total amount spent.
- Special offers, such as "Buy one red widget, get the second at half price".

## Features
- **Product Catalog**: Stores product details (code, name, price).
- **Delivery Charges**: Calculates delivery fees based on the total basket amount.
- **Offers**: Includes a special offer for Red Widget (R01) where buying one gets the second at half price.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. Import the SQL schema:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p < sql/schema.sql
3. Run the tests/test.php file in a PHP environment:
   ```bash
   php tests/test.php

## Class Breakdown
* **Product Class** (`src/Product.php`): Defines product attributes (code, name, price). 
* **Database Class** (`src/Database.php`): Manages MySQL connection and retrieves products from the database.
* **Offer Class** (src/Offer.php): The `Offer` class handles special offers for products in the shopping basket. 
  * If the product code matches the offer, it calculates the total cost of the items, applying the "Buy one, get one half price" offer:
    * For every two items purchased, the second item is charged at half price.
    * If there is an odd number of items, the remaining item is charged at the full price.
* **DeliveryCharges** Class (src/DeliveryCharges.php): Calculates delivery charges based on basket total.
* **Basket Class** (src/Basket.php): Handles the shopping basket, including adding products and calculating the final total.
  
## Testing 
Run `tests/test.php` to test the functionality of the basket, including the offer and delivery charges.

## Database Setup
The SQL schema (`sql/schema.sql`) creates the database `architech-labs-db` and inserts sample products into the `products` table.

## Assumptions
- The classes (`Product`, `Offer`, `DeliveryCharges`, `Basket`, `Database`) are designed to work as per the requirements outlined in the test and are used within the test script (`tests/test.php`).
- Since no specific instructions were given for CRUD operations on the products or on basket, the product data was seeded directly into the database through the `sql/schema.sql` file. These products are then used in the test script to show the functionality.
